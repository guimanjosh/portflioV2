    <h1>Matsuri Advertisement Committee Head</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Matsuri event is a Japanese festival held by the Japanese clubs at UCSD. This is an important event for not just Japanese clubs on campus, but for Japan in general as it is one of Japanâ€™s biggest events for the spread of Japanese Culture through food, live performances and games. It is important for the clubs because it is an opportunity for the club to grow bigger through recruitment and financial gain. For such a large-scale event, the Japanese student organizations recruited volunteers to help make the event happen with success. As a volunteer for this event as one of two of the advertisement committee head, our responsibility was to be able to reach out to as many people in the greater San Diego area and have a large attendance. Managing the design of the fliers and website was a crucial aspect in carrying effective advertisement.</p>
