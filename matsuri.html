                    <p>The Matsuri event is a Japanese festival held by the Japanese clubs at UCSD. This is an important event for not just Japanese clubs on campus, but for Japan in general as it is one of Japanâ€™s biggest events for the spread of Japanese Culture through food, live performances and games. It is important for the clubs because it is an opportunity for the club to grow bigger through recruitment and financial gain. For such a large-scale event, the Japanese student organizations recruited volunteers to help make the event happen with success. As a volunteer for this event as one of two of the advertisement committee head, our responsibility was to be able to reach out to as many people in the greater San Diego area and have a large attendance. Managing the design of the fliers and website was a crucial aspect in carrying effective advertisement.</p>

        <p><b>Problem Statement:</b> The UCSD Japanese student organizations want to reach out and advertise their event 
            to as many people as possible both on campus and in the greater San Diego area.

            order to have a large turnout?</p>
        <p><b>Proposed Solution:</b> Redesign and redevelop the Matsuri website's interface as it is the most
        important source of information for the event.</p>

                <p>Last year's developer listed all of the previous team members' names in an 
                    unorderly fashion. Using the concept "mapping" from Design of Everyday Things, 
                    I reordered each name such that the row being analyzed from the picture aligns 
                    with the names from a row being read. In addition, I used CSS to color the text 
                    so it is easier to match the name and the face!

        <p>Creating an important flier design, distributing fliers, an accessible information website with good design, and utilizing social media websites are the most important factors in carrying out effective advertising for the UCSD Matsuri event. Using both traditional and modern advertising methods is important to optimize the audience reach in order and coverage. Moreover, carrying out traditional flyering was important to reach those who do not typically use social media or audiences who minimize using technology in general. Additionally, traditional flyering  can also reach those who may have missed or skipped the online advertisement. On the other hand, the advertisement committee leveraged the fact that a large proportion of our target does use the internet and advertised online as well. Having an accessible website that provides a clear and concise itinerary for event attendees was important in encouraging them to commit to the event. Having an organized schedule of events, providing visual lists of Japanese foods being sold and games offered helped provide incentives for our audience to attend. The Matsuri data analysts noted that a large proportion of event goers from previous years attend primarily for the food. Music and dance performances were another important factor as they provide our audience rich auditory and visual entertainment. Lastly, the games helped gain younger attendees and those who enjoy games in general.</p>

        <p>The final product I created for the Japanese student organizations as an advertisement committee was a new version of the event website. Redesigning and organizing information on the website was crucial in effective advertisement and providing incentives for people to attend. The website served as an important foundation for the event and was accessed by approximately 2,200 people in the greater San Diego area.</p>
        <p>Through the use of flyering and social media advertisement posts, the advertisement committee was able to increase the event visibility and access to the website. Specifically, we found that around 800 people visited the website through facebook.</p>
        <p>Although this was our first virtual event and its transition to online was rushed, roughly 120 people attended the festival for that year, setting the bar for virtual events.
