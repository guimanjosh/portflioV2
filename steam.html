            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Video games have increased in popularity among today’s modern era. 
                With that said, video games were a common interest my group and I had, so we carried out a data 
                analysis project on Steam video games. With a large number of games offered and information about 
                the games provided by Steam, my group and I wanted to explore what data we can extract and how we can use 
                this data to generate insights about video games. We discovered that the Steam games platform 
                offers a rich amount of information and has a large number of users, especially in the United States. 
                Carrying out a study on the Steam games platform will be relevant and useful to the company, its 
                users and to those who play video games in general. With this study in mind, we wanted to also connect 
                how this connects back to the Steam games platforms overall user experience.

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Can the surface level information about a game, such as its title or other information Steam 
                provides such as its category or blurbs, determine how good it is? 
                Can saying or reading its title predict how a user will feel about the game? 
                Overall, can we make predictions about a video game’s quality considering multiple variables 
                such as its title, genre, blurbs?</p>

            <p>My teammate Ivy scraped data from Steam's website (fig. 1) using Python/Beautiful Soup and loaded the raw
                 data into a csv file (fig. 2). They let the program run througout the night in order
                  to collect about 75,000 games.

            <h5>"Incomplete data (any data rows with empty cells or null values), will obviously need to be cleaned.
                 What other values do we have to clean? What about games whose title does not use the Latin
                 alphabet?"</h5>

            </div>
            <p>We decided to not include these games as removing the non-Latin characters from its name would be too difficult.
            </p>
            <h5>"What about games whose titles have Latin characters but is not fully in English?"</h5>

            </div>
            <p>We figured that filtering out non-English games that still use the Latin alphabet would prove to be
                 too dificult to remove from our analysis. Moreover, we decided to keep such data through the Exploratory
                  Data Analysis.

            <p>To explore this problem, our group decided to carry out a sentiment analysis on the video 
                game titles and other information about the game in order to see if we can make predictions 
                if they will think a video game is good. Sentiment analysis can help us understand how text is 
                interpreted and is categorized as positive, negative or neutral. Our group and I understood that 
                personal taste is subjective and different users will have different feelings about a game, so 
                we had to immediately address how to define what a good game is. To define what a good game is, 
                it is a game with a large enough amount of reviews that has a review average of at least 4 stars 
                or greater. Overall, my group and I applied appropriate statistical tests and data processing in 
                order to generate meaningful insights about video game descriptions that the Steam platform offers.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The final product is an exploratory data analysis project that contributed to research on sentiment 
            analysis on video games. Our group explored sentiment analysis on video games and found out 
            this research field still needs more contributions as there are a lot of limitations and 
            uncertainties in this field. There are other researchers who carried out a similar study and also 
            acknowledge that there are limitations and uncertainties to be considered for this study. To get 
            back to the main point of the study and to conclude, our group found out that the multiple surface 
            level variables of video games such as its title, genre and blurb are capable of making a prediction 
            of its overall quality. Furthermore, surface level information about a video game is easily accessible 
            and Steam games or other gaming platforms can use this insight to promote certain games or make the 
            “good” games even more accessible.</p>
